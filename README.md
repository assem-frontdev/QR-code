## My process

- I struggle a bit when trying to center the box both horizontally and vertically but after doing a bit of research
 I found that flexbox can be one of the easiest and most modern ways to center elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make a good search when I struggle to find how to center elements in the easiest way.
Also, be patient when the design doesn't look like the original design. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="container"><section class="box"></section></section>
```
```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
}
```


### Continued development

I will ensure to continue working on most the free newbie challenges.
